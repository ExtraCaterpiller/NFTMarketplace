# NFT Marketplace
This repository contains the smart contract and Next.js frontend for an NFT marketplace. The marketplace allows users to list, sell, buy and cancel NFT listings. It also enables users to withdraw proceeds from their sales. The frontend is updated using a graph indexer to ensure real-time data synchronization.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- A Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) set up
- A local or testnet Ethereum blockchain running (e.g., Hardhat, Ganache)

## Usage
- Open your Web3 wallet and connect it to the application.
- Navigate through the application to list, buy or cancel NFT listings.
- Use the "Withdraw Proceeds" button to transfer your earnings to your wallet.
